                    <p>Also known as primary research, qualitative analysis demands interaction and real-time data. This
                        is
                        the process of collating data that hasnâ€™t been out there yet. Interviews, market research
                        surveys,
                        questionnaires, and more fall under qualitative or primary research.</p>
                    <p>At Aspects Fieldwork & Research, we conduct market research that adds a distinctive aspect to

            <p>The need for primary research arises when you want to know customer reviews before launching new products
                or
                services in the market. This essentially helps when you are competing with various other established
                brands
                of your kind. With the audience knowing what your organization intends to bring to the table,
                qualitative
                research helps you closely understand the pros and cons way before the launch.
